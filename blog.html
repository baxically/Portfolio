<h1>Robot Week Day 1 (July 7,2017)</h1> <!--Blog post for 07/10/17-->
<h2>How did your idea of robotics change? 
  
    </h2>
    <p>
   I have always believed that robots were electronics that were programmed to do certain things. I was never really concerned about them
   becoming smarter than humans. Due to our research today, however, I am a little concerned about it now. Things like self-driving cars 
   and Sophia scare me a bit.

<h2>What makes you excited about the future of robotics? Nervous?</h1>
    </h2>
  
<p>I excited for robots that can help people with disabilities! I am, however, worried that they will overrun the world and make the 
   humanrace even more lazy.

<h2>You worked on circuits in groups, and will be working in groups for the rest of the week. What worked well? What could you do better
  next time?
  </h2>
  <p>I really liked my group! They were all very cooperative and easy to talk to. I kind of regret that we decided to work around two tables.
    There was too much space and we couldn't all see the robot.

  <h2>What does Manuela Veloso's work have in common with Ayanna Howard's?</h2>
  <p>They're both trying to create robots that perform human taskks better than humans.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>How did your team work together on the lightshow?</h2>
  <p>Half of my team was more hands on and the other half was more creative/troubleshooting.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>What are the basic pieces of every Arduino sketch?</h2>
  <p>Every Arduino sketch needs an setup(), loop(), and inputs.</p>
